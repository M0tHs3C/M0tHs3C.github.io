# Hello there! i'm nothing!
### Welcome, general kenobi
Hello there, i go by the nickname of nothing, because this is such a common nick my username on github it's obviously differente but i quite like it never the less.
## Personal info
- 'Name': if my name is so relevant to you then you will have to look for it, i'm not hiding it but i dont want to spam my name on the web for no reason.
- 'Age' : i'm currently 21 years old atm, i don't know if i will remember to change this when my birthday occour
- 'Occupation' : i just started working at ![kerbersoweb](https://kerberosweb.com/) and i'm so happy about it and i do not intend to live this job for a long time
- 'Location' : Italy
## Personal interest
I'm currently studying computer engineering at a local university.
My most loved interest is cybersecurity in all of it's beauty, obvioulsy i'm not an expert and i will never pretend to be one, in this field you learn every day new things and this is excting for me
## What cybersecurity i do
- i often do a little bit of research on ![hackerone](https://hackerone.com/doc_nothing) but there's nothing much to see __¯\_(ツ)_/¯__
- i like to play ctfs on ![hackthebox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/83434) 

My preferred type of cts i do is boot2root since i like the ideology behind it to start with nothing and end with owning the machine
I'm kinda prepared to do reverse engineering but it's not definetly my pride and obviously i like bughunting on web apps

## current projects
If you open my github profile at ![this link](https://github.com/M0tHs3C) you will find several and simple tool i build
My pride is argo, a simple tool with a bunch of exploit loaded to own several type o cameras, i'm currently working on a newer version of it to extend it to a full spectrum of IoT device and it's exploit (if available obv) like dicom server,pacs, PLC and toaser or blenders, why not.
NOTE: this tool it's not intended to be a flex, of course i wrote some of the exploit myself without knowing that there are already some PoC on the web, this i just my big project to work out my mind to produce a good OOP code
## Language
I have a space in my heart for object-oriented programming language, i know: python, java, c++ and ruby
I know the basic of C and assambly but they come only from exam i did in university, not personal interest even if i know it's wrong
